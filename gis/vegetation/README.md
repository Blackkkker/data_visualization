Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is an improvement on the standard Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). [The NASA Earth Observatry explains it well](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_4.php):

>Derived from state-of-the-art satellite data provided by the MODIS instrument, EVI improves on NDVI's spatial resolution, is more sensitive to differences in heavily vegetated areas, and better corrects for atmospheric haze as well as the land surface beneath the vegetation.
